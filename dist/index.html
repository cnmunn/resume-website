    <p class="info-para">Hi, my name is Chris Munn and I’m an aspiring software engineer!  Welcome to my resume website, here you find out more about my personal projects, extra curriculars, and employment experience. I built this website so that I could create an easily distributable, detailed account of my professional life beyond what could fit on a standard 2-page resume. I am a second year Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. I am looking for an 8-month co-op position starting in Fall of 2020. Throughout my degree I have had classes working in Java, C, C++, and Python where I learned how to use Git, Github, the Unix Command line, and debugging tools such as Valgrind and GDB. In my own time, I have become more interested in Front End Web development. I’ve taught myself the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I’m now working on learning more frameworks for JavaScript such as Angular, Node.JS, and React.

      <h2>freeCodeCamp</h2>
      <p>I enrolled in freeCodeCamp in April of 2020 with two goals in mind. The first was to go over the foundational aspects of what I learned in school but didn't have the time to internalize, and the second being that I wanted to explore front end development more in depth. I'm not sure if I will stick with this path, but it has been really useful to learn and I enjoy how the elements of design play into practical aspect of programming. Not only does your program have to work, but it has to apeal to a wide audience that can interact with what you're building. I find being able to visually represent what you are coding really satisfying, so I'll probably stick with it.
